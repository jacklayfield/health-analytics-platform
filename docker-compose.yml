# NOTE: This file is an index / documentation for the repository's
# Docker Compose setups. It contains a human-friendly listing of
# per-component compose files and is NOT intended to be directly
# consumed by `docker compose` when it contains non-standard keys.
#
# To run the full stack, use the helper script `scripts/start-all.sh`
# or invoke `docker compose` with multiple `-f` flags, for example:
#
#   docker compose -f infra/docker-compose.yml \
#     -f etl/docker-compose.yml \
#     -f ml/docker-compose.yml \
#     -f dashboard/docker-compose.yml up --build
#
# The non-standard `include:` block that used to live below has been
# commented out to keep this file parseable by Docker Compose. See
# each subproject folder for its own `docker-compose.yml` and `.env`.

version: "3.9"

# Included compose files (human-readable reference). These lines are
# commented out on purpose because `include:` is not part of the
# Docker Compose spec; the helper scripts in `scripts/` perform the
# canonical merge at runtime.
